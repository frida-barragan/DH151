<h1> Hi! </h1>

<p> My name is <b>Frida Barragan</b> and I am a fourth-year, Biology major student at UCLA in California. I am living in Los Angeles and some of my favorite activities include volunteering, research, going to the beach and watching hours worth of Tiktoks a day. My goals for this course include to understand mapping a bit more and expand on the knowledge I acquired from the DH140 class I took last quarter.<i> I am really interested in understanding how websites are created and how they can be modified to better the user experience.</i></p>

This is a link to the group project we created last quarter: <i> <a href= "https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/9f5648663c374ba5a62c0f470fc87bd7"> </a> </i>
