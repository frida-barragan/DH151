                    <br>one can see that the number of programs in each service area do not necessarily 
                    <br>correspond with the populations of each service area. For example, SPA 2-San Fernando 
                    <br>has the largest population but only the third-most services. SPA 6-South is only 
                    <br>slightly smaller than SPA 4-Metro, yet the number of services in the former are 
                    <br>significantly less than in the latter. Of course, need is not just measured by 
                    <br>population size, so we turned to more demographic information to investigate the 
                    <br>discrepancies.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p align = "center"><b>Figure 2. </b>Another crucial factor is race of residents, as BIPOC communities are historically underresourced. <br> 
                        SPA-6 has the highest population of Black people and second highest population of Latinx people, <br>
                        speaking to the racism that structures disadvantages and exacerbates mental health issues by through <br>
                        the psychological and emotional tolls it can take on BIPOC people. Meanwhile, an area like SPA-2, which has <br>
                        the second highest white population has one of the highest numbers of programs. <br>
                        Further analysis can go into more depth about each service area, but there are clearly <br>
                        identified gaps between needs and services, geographically and demographically, that are already <br>
                        issues to be addressed.

                    <p align = "center"><b>Figure 3. </b>These graphs show the percentages of residents who are below the federal poverty line and who are uninsured, <br>
                        both demographic factors that affect accessibility to mental care. Unsurprisingly, SPA-6 has the highest percentages in these <br>
                        categories, showing that an extreme need for services is inaccessible both geographically and financially. <br>
                <p align = "center">
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <p align = "center"><b>Figure 4. </b>The first chart includes people at serious risk of depression, of which SPA6 has the highest percentage. <br>
                    This alone indicates a huge discrepancy between the number of mental health programs in SPA6 <br>
                    and its need for programs and services. One of the reasons for this discrepancy might be indicated in <br>
                    the second graph, which shows how residents of SPA6 have some of the lowest numbers of depression diagnosis. <br> 
                    Under-diagnosis of depression could be due to many factors, including people's inaccessibility to care or counseling <br>
                    such that they might recieve an official diagnosis in the first place. Of course, there are areas such as SPA 1-Antelope Valley <br>
                    that have both high risk of depression and high current rates, but, like with SPA-6 South, there is a serious lack of <br>
                    services in this area. Inaccessibility brings up additional disadvantages due to structural racism and inequality.
