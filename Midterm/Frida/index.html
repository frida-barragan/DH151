        <h1><u>Mental Health in LA County </u></h1>
<br>
        <p>
            Our project is an examination into the mental health crisis that has been rampant in Los Angeles County in recent years. <br>
            We intend to use geographical data and visualizations to understand where mental health services are most in demand, what <br>
            individuals most need these services and the factors that contribute to difficulties accessing these resources. Moreover, <br>
            this analysis is intended to highlight the shortcomings of the current mental health programs that exist in Los Angeles <br>
            County that are not necessarily obtainable for all individuals. This project is for all individuals whose mental health <br>
            issues have had a negative impact in their livelihood, for those who know someone whose mental health has affected their <br>
            quality of life and for those who have the power to expand mental health resources. Our project is about <b>awareness.</b>
