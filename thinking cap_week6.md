<b>What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?"</b>
<br>
I think that thick mapping in the digital humanities can be used, as mentioned in the book, to fully create a visual that can always be modified by adding/changing layers. From the reading, I can understand thick mapping as a sort of <b>“reversed onion”</b> in the sense that the more layers one adds (opposed to peel), the more one can understand about the subject/location/story one is mapping about. Also, I think thick mapping can be compared to the existence of humans as continuously changing organisms in that each life experience can be considered a “layer” and although some people might share similar core experiences, in the end all the layers combine to create individuals unique to their own story. The reading defines mapping a visual representation of <b>“set of relations”</b> which can take different forms and are always evolving while thick mapping is referred to as the visual representation of <b>dynamics</b> through the combination of changing layers.

<b>How does the theory of "thick mapping" inform narratives that are influencing your life?</b>
<br>
I think that the theory of “thick mapping” create multiple perspectives or narratives of what might be the same map so in a sense they provide a wide array of options that one can see.  I think “thick mapping” can be adapted to our own experience because we might be more likely to relate to and understand a map with “layers” similar to our own. At the same time, it creates a contrast between opposite maps/stories allowing for “conflict” and opposing representations decreasing the chances of having just one overpowering unified experience.
