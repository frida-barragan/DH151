  <h1><center>Our mission</center></h1>
  <p><center>
    Our project is an examination into the mental health crisis that has been rampant in Los Angeles County in recent years. <br>
    We intend to use geographical data and visualizations to understand where mental health services are most in demand, what <br>
    individuals most need these services and the factors that contribute to difficulties accessing these resources. Moreover, <br>
    this analysis is intended to highlight the shortcomings of the current mental health programs that exist in Los Angeles <br>
    County that are not necessarily obtainable for all individuals. This project is for all individuals whose mental health <br>
    issues have had a negative impact in their livelihood, for those who know someone whose mental health has affected their <br>
    quality of life and for those who have the power to expand mental health resources. Our project is about <b>awareness.</b> </center>
    </p>  
    <h1><center>Why it matters?</center></h1>
    <p><center>Approximately 17% of adults in California suffer from some kind of mental health condition.</center> </p>
