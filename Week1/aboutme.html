        <p> My name is <b>Frida Barragan</b> and I am a fourth-year, Biology major student at UCLA in California. 
            I am living in Los Angeles and some of my favorite activities include volunteering, research, going to the beach and watching hours worth of Tiktoks a day. 
            My goals for this course include to understand mapping a bit more and expand on the knowledge I acquired from the DH140 class I took last quarter.<i> 
            I am really interested in understanding how websites are created and how they can be modified to better the user experience.</i></p>
                <br>
        This is a link to the group project I helped create last quarter: <i> <a href= "https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/9f5648663c374ba5a62c0f470fc87bd7" target="_blank">Click me</a> </i>
        <br>

        Some of the topics I am interested include: 
            <ul>
                <li> Healthcare accessibility </li>
                <li> Income and its effect on health </li>
                <li> Language barriers and its effects on health care services </li>
