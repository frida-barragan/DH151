This site's agenda is to calculate the distance and routes for travelers in Europe. The website/app is designed to provide the user with the best route availaible and potential itineraries for easy comparison. 

I find this website really interesting because it offers the carbon footprint that the user's potential trip and mode of transportation will have on the planet, which I think is very useful for people who want to choose the more "green" option.

These maps work by mapping the distance between the origin and the destination, then the best route with established roads is determined. As for the carbon footprint, it is determined by calculating the percentage share of the tire's contribution to vehicular CO2 emissions.

Via Michelin uses TomTom 2006-2016 for its navigation. 

If I could change something about Via Michelin it would be to expand it to also other continents and not exclusive to Europe. I would also update its interface to be more user-friendly and decrease the number of ads present. Finally, I would suggest updating their navigation system due to the highh dissatisfaction online users have expressed.
